                        Technology is pervasive in our society. It impacts almost every field of study and every career path. We often see technology through the lens of a consumer - we carry it in our pocket, use it at work, have it control our homes, and entertain children. 
                        <img src="img/main3.jpg" class="pull-right gap-left img-rounded">
                        Being a producer of technology, the ability to think computationally, unlocks our creative side; it provides a venue to learn how to decompose a problem into a set of tasks, sequence and prioritize those tasks, and execute towards a completed realization of a vision. For our children, producing technology provides a means to develop lifelong skills in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). It is generally seen as having wide applicability beyond just Computer Science or any technical discipline for that matter.

                    <p class="text-muted text-justify">
                        Our school systems do an excellent job of navigating through federal and state regulations to teach the fundamentals. However, district curriculum has evolved ever so slightly with technological change. Unfortunately, Computer Science is not seen as a priority and is largely absent in our schools' curriculum. <a href="https://code.org/promote/nj" target="_blank">Code.org</a> collects and provides the statistics that describe the problem and opportunity. The bottom line is that, much like learning a second language, kids can become computational thinkers if given an adequate instructional platform and people who can produce technology have access to an abundance of well paying jobs (<a href="http://www.indeed.com/salary/q-Computer-Science-l-Philadelphia,-PA.html" target="_blank">local area</a>, <a href="http://www.indeed.com/salary?q1=Computer+Science&l1=Washington%2C+DC" target="_blank">DC</a>).

                      We teach using the “tools of the trade”. Not only do our aspiring innovators see real-world applications of technology, they learn to code using the same tools as the pros!

                      <!--<img src="img/main2.jpg" class="pull-right gap-left img-rounded">-->There are no hard and fast rules for technology education. In broad terms, the computing industry is still in a relatively infantile stage. Teaching children to code, while largely identified as relevant and important in today’s age, lacks the formalities that we work expect to see from math or the hard sciences. As we’ve seen first hand, kids exposure to technology and coding varies greatly on an individual-by-individual basis.

                    <p class="text-faded text-justify">
                      Predicate Academy builds curriculum across three “learning tiers”. These tiers are largely split around suggested age with slightly differing learning objectives:
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-faded text-justify">
                      <b><i>Adventures (ages 8-10 / 3-5 grade).</i></b> Focus on teaching the fundamentals of coding and computational thinking. We emphasize coding syntax and structure. Applications and coding exercises are generally lighter in complexity and more demonstrative of the power of writing code. Some familiarity with the keyboard and mouse is expected.
                    <BR><BR>
                    <b><i>Foundations (ages 9-13 / 4-7 grade).</i></b> Focus on “real world” applications of technology. Aspiring innovators will see how technology is used and will learn the basics of coding through examples. Real world applications may introduce complex coding use cases and advanced programming language features. Command of the keyboard and mouse is expected as some programming problems will be typing intensive.
                    <BR><BR>
                    <b><i>Journey (ages 12-15+ / 6-9+ grade).</i></b> Journey builds on Foundations with a continued focus on “real world” application. Aspiring innovators that take Journey level courses will learn the importance of establishing a portfolio of coding artifacts that can be showcased as part of their mastery of skills. A coding portfolio can be used as part of a college admission package as well as a recruiting tool for future employment.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-faded text-justify">
                    There is no fix rule for movement between these learning tiers. As parents, we naturally want to challenge our children. All of these tiers will challenge everybody! Placement in a tier is largely based on technical and social maturity. Placement varies on a case-by-case basis – we have some 9 year olds that would be a great fit for Journey level classes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-faded text-justify">
                    Predicate Academy program offerings operate on a 10 week / 60 minute per session schedule. All of our students start with <a href="bootcamp.html" class="blacklink">Predicate Bootcamp</a>, an introductory course that provides broad exposure to the varying facets of working with technology and the fundamentals of computational thinking.  As part of this introductory course, students will assemble their own <i>Predi-Kit</i> hardware bundle then dive into the basics of Raspbian, the Pi’s Linux-based operating system, as well as key concepts such as hardware interfacing and writing code.

                        We created Predicate Academy to provide a platform for making advanced technology more accessible. We see technology development as an art that is mastered with time. Much like learning a musical instrument, crafting a skill requires practice across varying applications and a mentor to provide encouragement and direction. As a platform, Predicate Academy provides a launching pad for students to obtain the breadth of computer science principals and practices, building lifelong skills that supersede trends and are applicable regardless of career path.

                        My first exposure to technology was in the 10th grade in a year long elective that focused on the fabrication and assembly of a programmable circuit board. The hardware coupled with Microsoft’s QuickBASIC programming language, provided a means of using software to control the physical world. For me, this class was a defining moment in my life - I started to appreciate technology from the lens of a producer. Technology made learning fun.

For the past 15 years I’ve had the opportunity to work on advanced research projects in support of our nation's defense. Many of these projects sprung out of an initial idea - thinking about technology a different way - that led to design, development, and deployment with the military to make a difference.

In the last 10 years I’ve seen technological innovation greatly improve patient care and services.  Wearable technology, 3D biological materials, genome sequencing are just a few of the advancements we have seen. If I am honest, I was always a little reluctant to let technology “take over” my profession, but the transformations and possibilities that exist now leave me excited about what the future of healthcare holds.

                    <p class="text-faded text-justify">
                        My background is in Business Management and not at all in Computer Technology. I graduated from Rider University with a Bachelor’s in Business Administration and Management and went on to work in different areas of business such as Office Management, Accounts Payable/Receivables and ultimately as a Staff Accountant. Having three children, I have been forced into a new world of technology that was not around when I was starting my career. Much has changed and the need for a strong knowledge of technology is ever growing for the youth of today, hence my interest in Predicate Academy’s success. Once my children were school age, I became very involved in our schools and community. I’ve held board positions on the Swedesboro-Woolwich PTO as well as in a rapidly growing MOMS Club of Woolwich where I went further on to mentor other MOMS Clubs in the South Jersey area.  Among my many volunteer roles, I take most pride in running our PTO Scholastic Book Fairs for all 4 schools in the district for over 5 years. Helping our schools promote literacy and raise money so that they could provide classrooms with technology such as laptops or Smart Boards was very rewarding. Volunteering led to working in the schools as a substitute teacher for grades K-6. Working with our youth has been a valuable experience and has given me a new understanding of ever changing curriculums, expectations of students and teachers as well as the need for differentiated teaching, creativity and a “think-outside-the-box” mentality in the face of diversity and constant change in our world. Predicate Academy is giving children an opportunity to nurture their creativity and “think-outside-the-box” which is exciting for me to be a part of!

                    I currently support both the Chinook and Osprey programs as an aircraft technician at Boeing Helicopters. I briefly studied at Rowan University as a Biological Science major in plans of going into the Biotechnology field. I am married and have 5 children ranging from under 1yr to high school age. At home we try to impress upon the kids the drive for higher learning and to think outside the box. Besides one class in high school and things my father has showed me over the years; everything I know is self taught. I have dabbled with a very broad range of technology from structured to unorthodox for over 20+ years. I think that I align pretty well with the mantra that Predicate follows and relate with the students because I used to be just like them. They have a chance to create anything they can possibly imagine and feel empowered while doing it.
