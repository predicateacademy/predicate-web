                            Predicate Academy is an immersive instructional experience positioned at the intersection of the physical and virtual worlds. We provide a creative curriculum series where we teach lifelong skills that stimulate the mind to think about approaching advanced technology with an eye for innovation. Our programs are designed to build stuff, solve hard problems, appreciate the diverse perspectives of teamwork, and have a great deal of fun along the way. Predicate Academy provides a gentle introduction to the field of Computer Science - we teach the core concepts through applications that include aspects of hardware, programming, algorithmic and game design as well as robotics.

                        Technology is pervasive in our society. It impacts almost every field of study and every career path. We often see technology through the lens of a consumer - we carry it in our pocket, use it at work, have it control our homes, and entertain children. <IMG SRC="img/matthew-python.jpg" CLASS="right-wrap">Being a producer of technology, the ability to think computationally, unlocks our creative side; it provides a venue to learn how to decompose a problem into a set of tasks, sequence and prioritize those tasks, and execute towards a completed realization of a vision. For our children, producing technology provides a means to develop lifelong skills in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). It is generally seen as having wide applicability beyond just Computer Science or any technical discipline for that matter.

                        Our school systems do an excellent job of navigating through federal and state regulations to teach the fundamentals. District curriculum has evolved ever so slightly with technological change - learning to type frequently takes priority over cursive. Unfortunately, Computer Science is not seen as a priority and is largely absent in our school’s curriculum. <a href="https://code.org/promote/nj" target="_blank">Code.org</a> does an excellent job culling the statistics that describe the problem and opportunity. The bottom line is that, much like learning a second language, kids can grok computational thinking if given an adequate instructional platform and people who can produce technology have access to an abundance of well paying jobs.

                    At Predicate Academy we believe in the value of the instructional experience. Our curriculum series \directly reflects where we see technology trending. Each program guides students through a complete design process with pivot points to allow for individualization and ownership of the resulting project.

                    <IMG SRC="img/bootcamp.jpg" CLASS="left-wrap">Predicate Academy program offerings range between 10-20 weeks depending on the complexity of the subject and the approximate amount of time to complete the project. All of our students start with Ninja Bootcamp, a 10 week course that provides broad exposure to the varying facets of working with technology and the fundamentals of computational thinking.  As part of this introductory course, students will assemble their own Raspberry Pi computer and HDMI monitor. We’ll then cover the basics of Raspbian, the Pi’s Linux-based operating system, as well as key concepts such as networking, hardware interfacing, and the basic building blocks of writing code. Upon completion of bootcamp, students can opt to focus on a hardware or programming specific track as well as a combined track that covers both aspects.

                    Most of our programs are designed for kids in fourth grade through high school. When possible, we cluster students by age range so they can work in comparably aged peer groups. We also offer separate programs for adults who are interested in learning a new skill or hobby. Private instruction is available for those interested in focusing on a particular area of interest.

                        We created Predicate Academy as a platform for making advanced technology more accessible. We see technology development as an art that is mastered with time. Much like learning an musical instrument, crafting a skill requires practice across varying applications and a mentor to provide encouragement and direction. As a platform, Predicate Academy, provides a regular environment where students obtain the breadth and depth of the technology field, building lifelong skills that supersede trends and are applicable regardless of career path.

                    <p>
                        My first exposure to technology was in the 10th grade in a year long elective that focused on the fabrication and assembly of a programmable circuit board. The hardware coupled with Microsoft’s QuickBASIC programming language, provided a means of using software to control the physical world. For me, this class was a defining moment in my life - I started to appreciate technology from the lens of a producer. Technology made learning fun. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have a BA in Computer Science from Rutgers University and a MS in Computer Science from Drexel University. For the past 15 years I’ve had the opportunity to work on advanced research projects in support of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) - a Department of Defense agency that invests in disruptive technologies for national security. Many of these projects sprung out of an initial idea - thinking about technology a different way - that led to design, development, and deployment with the military to make a difference. 
                    </p> 
                        <h4>Lizbeth Rivera Orr - Operations Manager</h4>
                    <p>
                        My background is not in technology, it is in healthcare. I have a PharmD from Rutgers University and have practiced as a pharmacist in several disciplines including retail, hospital, and home infusion. In the last 10 years I’ve seen technological innovation greatly improve patient care and services.  Wearable technology, 3D biological materials, genome sequencing are just a few of the advancements we have seen. If I am honest, I was always a little reluctant to let technology “take over” my profession, but the transformations and possibilities that exist now leave me excited about what the future of healthcare holds.
