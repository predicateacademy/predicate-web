We are an independent company founded by a Woolwich NJ resident with a passion to teach children how to code. We create our own courses with a goal of providing a glimpse into the computing field. Not only do we teach coding, we demonstrate “real world” applications of technology and do so in an environment that is ripe with learning opportunity and fun. Our objective is simple - we want to show the hidden educational value of making technology (<a href="http://www.predicate.us/wordpress/index.php/2016/07/21/the-hidden-value-of-going-behind-the-scenes/" class="blacklink" target=_blank>read more</a>).

                        Predicate Academy runs four "seasonal" sessions a year with classes that meet for 8-10 instructional hours (normally one hour a week). In addition to our seasonal sessions, we also offer a number of single class offerings that are a great way to learn about the power of creating with code or explore a new technical topic.

                        Technology is pervasive in our society. It impacts almost every field of study and every career path. We often see technology through the lens of a consumer - we carry it in our pocket, use it at work, have it control our homes, and entertain children. 
                        <img src="img/main3.jpg" class="pull-right gap-left img-rounded">
                        Being a producer of technology, the ability to think computationally, unlocks our creative side; it provides a venue to learn how to decompose a problem into a set of tasks, sequence and prioritize those tasks, and execute towards a completed realization of a vision. For our children, producing technology provides a means to develop lifelong skills in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). It is generally seen as having wide applicability beyond just Computer Science or any technical discipline for that matter.

                        Our school systems do an excellent job of navigating through federal and state regulations to teach the fundamentals. However, district curriculum has evolved ever so slightly with technological change. Unfortunately, Computer Science is not seen as a priority and is largely absent in our schools' curriculum. <a href="https://code.org/promote/nj" target="_blank">Code.org</a> collects and provides the statistics that describe the problem and opportunity. The bottom line is that, much like learning a second language, kids can become computational thinkers if given an adequate instructional platform and people who can produce technology have access to an abundance of well paying jobs (<a href="http://www.indeed.com/salary/q-Computer-Science-l-Philadelphia,-PA.html" target="_blank">local area</a>, <a href="http://www.indeed.com/salary?q1=Computer+Science&l1=Washington%2C+DC" target="_blank">DC</a>).

                      We teach using the “tools of the trade”. Not only do our aspiring innovators see real-world applications of technology, they learn to code using the same tools as the pros!

                      <!--<img src="img/main2.jpg" class="pull-right gap-left img-rounded">-->There are no hard and fast rules for technology education. In broad terms, the computing industry is still in a relatively infantile stage. Teaching children to code, while largely identified as relevant and important in today’s age, lacks the formalities that we work expect to see from math or the hard sciences. As we’ve seen first hand, kids exposure to technology and coding varies greatly on an individual-by-individual basis.

                    <p class="text-faded text-justify">
                      Predicate Academy builds curriculum across three “learning tiers”. These tiers are largely split around suggested age with slightly differing learning objectives:
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-faded text-justify">
                      <b><i>Adventures (ages 8-10 / 3-5 grade).</i></b> Focus on teaching the fundamentals of coding and computational thinking. We emphasize coding syntax and structure. Applications and coding exercises are generally lighter in complexity and more demonstrative of the power of writing code. Some familiarity with the keyboard and mouse is expected.
                    <BR><BR>
                    <b><i>Foundations (ages 10-12 / 5-7 grade).</i></b> Focus on “real world” applications of technology. Aspiring innovators will see how technology is used and will learn the basics of coding through examples. Real world applications may introduce complex coding use cases and advanced programming language features. Command of the keyboard and mouse is expected as some programming problems will be typing intensive.
                    <BR><BR>
                    <b><i>Journey (ages 12-15+ / 7-9+ grade).</i></b> Journey builds on Foundations with a continued focus on “real world” application. Aspiring innovators that take Journey level courses will learn the importance of establishing a portfolio of coding artifacts that can be showcased as part of their mastery of skills. A coding portfolio can be used as part of a college admission package as well as a recruiting tool for future employment. <a href="/journey" class="blacklink">Click here</a> for a sample of our Journey projects.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-faded text-justify">
                    There is no fix rule for movement between these learning tiers. As parents, we naturally want to challenge our children. All of these tiers will challenge everybody! Placement in a tier is largely based on technical and social maturity. Placement varies on a case-by-case basis – we have some 9 year olds that would be a great fit for Journey level classes.

                            <b>Minecraft Mashup (Adventures, ages 8-10)</b> - We'll be teaching our youngest of innovators how to create basic mods in Minecraft (Raspberry Pi Edition) using the python programming language. The mods will literally inject a bunch of fun into what is already considered to be a favorite game for kids. Adventures Innovators will learn the basics of a text coding language, file management, and cause and effect. We will be encouraging peer collaboration as coding is best experienced (and learned) in small teams.

                            <b>Coding with Cameras (Foundations, ages 10-12)</b> - This class will explore all the fun things that can be done when code is combined with a camera. We'll create a custom photo booth with digital overlays (e.g. funny hats, glasses, "Wanted!" borders, etc.), green screen effects, and animated gifs. The class will also cover the basics of camera control and image processing. All innovators will receive an upgraded 16GB SD memory card to hold all of their pictures. All camera supplies will be provided for use during the class.

                            <b>Puppet Masters (Foundations, ages 10-12 / Journey, ages 12+)</b> - NEW FOR FALL!! We’ll be all the fun things that can be done automating puppet movements with a Raspberry PI computer. This class will use a mariachi style puppet (yes, they are a little creepy) with string controls for arms and legs that will be wired into individual servo motors. The possibilities are endless! This class will be a form of robotics but with puppets in lieu of rovers.

                            <b>Capture the Flag: Introduction to Hacking (Journey, ages 12+)</b> – NEW FOR FALL!! We’re finally caving to the demands of our Journey Innovators and plan to offer a brand-new class that introduces the fundamentals of hacking. Since we launched Predicate in 2016, hacking has been the top request and we think we’ve found a way to deliver instruction that showcases some pretty cool concepts while still having fun (a requirement for any Predicate class). Parents – we plan to provide a safe environment for conceptual exploration and <b>will not</b> be engaging in nefarious activities. This class will cover reconnaissance, encryption, remote execution, exfiltration, and other cool approaches like hiding in plain sight. The classes will be structured around a “Capture the Flag” game where teams complete. NOTE: we will make heavy use of the Linux terminal (and typing). <i>Please reach out with any questions prior to registration.</i>

Every student is automatically enrolled into our loyalty program that provides tuition credits for continued enrollment and new referrals. Our program is simple: earn one week for <i>every registered seasonal class</i></li> AND
                            earn one week for <i>every friend referral</i> that registers for a seasonal class.
