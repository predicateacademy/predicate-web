                    The Equation Computer Kit includes the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B micro-computer, 7” touchscreen display, flexible case, USB power adapter, and 8GB class 10 SD card that is preloaded with Raspbian Linux and a curated assortment of some of our favorite software packages. This is a complete computer kit that just requires Internet access and a touch of curiosity. Browse the web with Google Chrome - check. Play Minecraft - check. Word Processing and Spreadsheets - check. Ability to code? Why not in three languages - Python, Java, and Scratch - check, check, and check.

                      Building a sense of ownership and accomplishment starts on Day 1 when your aspiring innovator assembles their computer kit under supervision of the Predicate Instructional Team. Once they leave our studio, this kit is meant to be used and abused - all in the spirit of learning. While you may need to be careful with those smartphones and tablets, every single part of the Equation Computer Kit is fully replaceable. Don’t worry parents, let them explore!

                      Since launching Predicate, we frequently encounter two cases that stun the technical development of an aspiring innovator - discouragement and plateaus.  First and foremost, there is a constant battle against discouragement. We see this regularly in our seasonal classes - and it comes by way of the often spoken line “it’s not working!”. Learning to code is in many cases learning from mistakes. The key to keeping discouragement at bay is to quickly identify, correct, and shape a learning opportunity around a misstep. The longer a problem festers, the greater the amount of discouragement. Second, we often see our innovators falling into a plateau - they build up just enough skills to get comfortable and don’t seek beyond their comfort zone (in many cases for fear of discouragement). Plateaus lead to boredom. Learning technology is very much a lifelong journey as the field is constantly changing.  Good technologists are “fit for change” and we need to ensure the same for our children.

                    <p class="text-muted text-justify">
                      In addition to the Equation Computer Kit, we’re really excited to announce Predicate Sessions, a new series of 90-minute / $40 “drop in” classes that will focus on a variety of general computing and coding topics. While the Equation Kit offers the seed for creating an innovator, we recognize that hardware and self study alone may not work for everyone. Our Sessions and 10-week Foundations classes are a very effective way to cultivate the learning process. Sessions are great for those who cannot commit to weekly classes but are still interested in learning more about the field and then go home and practice what they’ve learned. Sessions will keep the Equation Kit primed with the latest software and reset (as needed) conditions back to factory default settings. Don’t worry parents! Help is just a session away!

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                    <hr class="light">
<p class="text-faded text-justify">
<b><i>Is it possible to ship an Equation Computer Kit to my home?</b></i><BR>
Unfortunately, at the present time, the Equation Kit is only available for pickup at our studio in Logan Twp, NJ.
</p>

<p class="text-faded text-justify">
<b><i>Are we eligible to purchase the Equation Kit if we are not presently enrolled at Predicate?</b></i><BR>
Anyone is eligible to purchase an Equation Kit. Session availability is offered on a first come, first served basis.
</p>

<p class="text-faded text-justify">
<b><i>What is the suggested age for Equation Kit?</b></i><BR>
Our suggested minimum age for assembly and participation in the first session is 8.
</p>

<p class="text-faded text-justify">
<b><i>Can adults buy the Equation Kit?</b></i><BR>
Absolutely. Coding is not just great for kids :)
</p>

<p class="text-faded text-justify">
<b><i>If we purchase a kit do we need to sign up for any sessions?</b></i><BR>
Participation in the sessions are completely optional. You can sign up for as many as your schedule permits or none at all.
</p>

<p class="text-faded text-justify">
<b><i>What is the cost of a 90-minute session?</b></i><BR>
The first 90-minute session is included in the cost of the Equation Computer Kit. Each additional session is priced at $40. Some sessions may introduce hardware that will be priced in addition to the $40 session.
</p>

<p class="text-faded text-justify">
<b><i>Does the Equation Kit provide everything that my child needs to learn how to code?</b></i><BR>
Yes! The Equation Kit is ready to go. All you need is an Internet connection (wired or wifi).
</p>

<p class="text-faded text-justify">
<b><i>If we purchase a kit and want to take other classes are we still required to enroll in Predicate’s Bootcamp program?</b></i><BR>
Yes! Completion of Predicate’s Bootcamp program is still a requirement for any other 10-week seasonal program we offer at the academy.
</p>

<p class="text-faded text-justify">
<b><i>How does the Equation + Session program differ from Predicate’s 10-week seasonal courses?</b></i><BR>
Sessions are “single shot” 90-minute classes focused around exploring the potential of the field. We will tackle a number of concepts - learning how to use and maintain Raspbian operating system, installing new software, converting the kit into gaming console, among others. There will be little overlap with our 10-week seasonal courses that focus on providing depth of instruction on a particular topic. It is possible to participate in either or both the seasonal courses as well as the sessions.
</p>

<p class="text-faded text-justify">
<b><i>Can the Equation Kit be used for any of Predicate’s seasonal courses?</b></i><BR>
Yes! We'll adjust the cost of any hardware kit to account for parts you may already have.
</p>

<p class="text-faded text-justify">
<b><i>How does the Equation Kit compare with Kano and other Raspberry Pi kits?</b></i><BR> 
Predicate Academy sells hardware at cost and we pride ourselves on our instructional experience. Our Equation Kit is often the same hardware as other kits, but offered at a substantial discount. We recognize that our aspiring innovators thrive when good technology is combined with good instruction. Our focus is providing good technology at cost and differentiating ourselves with superior instruction.
